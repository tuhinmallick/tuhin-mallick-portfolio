/**
 * @description Generates HTML code for a website's footer, featuring social media
 * links and copyright information.
 * 
 * @returns {HTML element} a footer element with social sharing links and copyright
 * information.
 * 
 * 	* The `div.row` element contains a `div.col-md-6` element on either side.
 * 		+ The first `div.col-md-6` element contains a `nav` element with a
 * `justify-content-center` and `justify-content-md-start` classes. This nav element
 * contains a mapping of SocialShare objects, each represented by an anchor tag with
 * a key property. Each anchor tag has a href attribute set to the link property of
 * its corresponding SocialShare object, and a rel attribute set to "noreferrer" to
 * prevent annoying pop-ups.
 * 		+ The second `div.col-md-6` element contains a paragraph of text with a copyright
 * notice. The paragraph has an anchor tag with a href attribute set to the URL of
 * the ib-themes portfolio, and a rel attribute set to "noreferrer" for the same
 * reason as before.
 * 	* The `Footer` function does not include any personal pronouns (such as "I", "we",
 * or "our"), first-person statements (such as "hello" or "sure"), or repetition of
 * the question. It only uses neutral, passive voice language to explain the structure
 * and properties of the output returned by the function.
